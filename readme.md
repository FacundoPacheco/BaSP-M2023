## Week-03
In point number three of the weekly problem, we are informed that we must make the corrections that the tutor marked for us in the folder for week three. I made a mistake and fixed it from week two, so I pushed the week two index.html as it was before it was fixed, and did it again in week three.

- During week 03 we work with css design on the html page of week 02

## Week-04
- At the beginning of week 04, fixed what was wrong with week 03.

- After fixing the week 03 bugs, we did a responsive job so that the week 03 page looks on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

-in week 04 we used the flexbox method as css.


## Week-05
- In week 05 we had a problem to work on that consisted of two stages: the first was to correct what was done in week 04 according to what the tutor said, and the second was to work with javascript principles

- In week 05 we had to do the following operations:
- variables and operators, strings, arrays, if-else, for, functions.

-In the last commit of week 05 I wanted to say: "BaSP-W05-2023 6-d"-e" finished

## Week-06
- In week 06 we had to create a login page and a registration page.
